Diamond Price Prediction
This project aims to predict the price of diamonds based on various features and characteristics. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can analyze a dataset of diamond attributes and their corresponding prices to develop a predictive model.

Got 93.68% Accuracy on this Project from Linear Regression.


Project Overview
Diamonds are valuable gemstones, and their prices depend on a combination of factors such as carat weight, cut quality, color grade, and clarity grade. This project aims to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of a diamond given its characteristics.

The prediction model utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze a dataset containing various attributes of diamonds and their corresponding prices. By training the model on this data, it can learn the patterns and relationships between the features and the target variable (price). Once trained, the model can be used to predict the price of new, unseen diamonds.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about diamonds, including attributes such as carat weight, cut quality, color grade, clarity grade, and other relevant features. It also includes the corresponding price for each diamond.
